# Virtual-Memory-Simulator
This C program simulates virtual memory management using different page replacement algorithms: NRU (Not Recently Used), LRU (Least Recently Used), Second-Chance, and Optimal (OTM). It processes a memory access log, calculates page faults, and tracks dirty pages (written back to disk).
